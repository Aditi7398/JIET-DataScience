I have made an Air Quality Index Visualisation Dash App.
This project will showcase and visualise the Air Quality Index of different cities of India.
An air quality index (AQI) is used by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become.
Public health risks increase as the AQI rises.
Different countries have their own air quality indices, corresponding to different national air quality standards.

How It Works:
1.) Select the state of India from dropdown menu.
2.) Then select the city of which you want to know the air quality index.
3.)The graph with different pollutants avg of you city will be visualised.
